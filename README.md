# Espers 
I gather here my thoughts and questionning about Espers blockchain project. Feel free to add your reflexion by doing pull requests :)

## General statement

Keep in mind when you read this that my point of view is the one of someone that has been looking into blockchain only since 6-8 month. I might not have strong enough technical skills but I think I’m understanding the blockchain universe pretty well.

* French
* Finished Master in Engineering – Sofware architecture in Embeded systems
* Food Startup Co-founder, in charge of technical stuff (website, backoffice, app, logistic …)
* Product Manager, Front-end developper 

I’ve been in the startup environnent since i finished school 2.5 years ago now and can now estimate the different criteria that make a project successful. 

Let’s cut the bs talk and get into it :)
